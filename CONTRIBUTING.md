# Contributing to MVR Open Source Projects

MVR welcomes contributions to our open source projects on Github. When contributing, please follow the MVR Community Code of Conduct.

## Contributing

Please refer to each project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub. <br>
2. Clone the project to your own machine. <br>
3. Commit changes to your own branch. <br>
4. Push your work back up to your fork. <br>
5. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes. <br>

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
